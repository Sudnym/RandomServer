# RandomServer
 
RandomServer is half of a project i'm working on to kill boredom of the masses.

*enter me*

The purpose of RandomServer is to allow any average joe to set up a random server and allow other average joe's to send him stuff using RandomClient (https://github.com/Sudnym/RandomClient).

# The How

RandomServer uses gnet (https://github.com/panjf2000/gnet) to set up a server that awaits connections and uses diffie hellman key exchange (https://github.com/monnand/dhkx) to create e2e encryption, and then the server recieves a message, and sends the message to the terminal.

# The Why

Why not? Set one up, see what you get!

# The Client
